1. Forecast Number of Clusters of Artificial DataForecast Number of Clusters of Artificial Data

We then applied K means clustering to find those 4 clusters.


2. Predicting the Type of College using K-Means ClusteringPredicting the Type of College using K-Means Clustering

We used College_Data to predict whether the college is private or not using features
such as Grad Rate, Room Board, Outstate etc. 
After that, K means clustering was applied to find the clusters 
that predict whether the college is private or not.
